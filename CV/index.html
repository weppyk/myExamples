            <h2>My CV</h2>
            <p>I never studied school with IT. When I started, there wereÂ´nt any. I worked with PC like a hobby. The PC was very new and I remember,
                 when we (my brother and me) explored the possibility of first languages like Basic with equipment like Didaktik M,
                 and later Assembler and Pascal. It was revolutionary with spread new PC model 286. For most time of my live was programming more hobby,
                than fulltime work. Mostly I have been working in musical instrument company, on manager position, later CEO. 
                Software engineering and technologies for needs of this companies were on daily base. Linux was the main system I deployed in. When we needed some organisations of informations about Suppliers,
                I used Drupal, riding service for musical instrument, so I implement Redmine with tickets. When I started own businnes, 
                there was so many use cases, like analyses working with API of businness software Flexibee, connecting with e-commerce, suppliers, running crons,
                , that after research I started implementing with Symfony 2. 
            </p>
            <p>In year 2022 Businnes works with my minimum participation so in this year I decided, that I will make this my hobby for part time up to fulltime job.
                In second quartal this year I decided to improve quality of my fullstack programming and I started with courses aim to software engineering, fullstack developing,
                software architecture and I am preparing for AWS Developer Certified.
